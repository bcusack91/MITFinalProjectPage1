#Portfolio Project

<b>Title of the project:</b> MIT Portfolio Project <br>
<b>Description of the project:</b> In this project, I created a landing page where people can see more information about me.  Using bootstrap, I added a navbar, which has a tab for a projects page. On the projects page, prospective employers can see some of the work I completed in this class<br>
<b>Roadmap of future improvements:</b> This website certainly needs work on the visuals.  I would like to do more to block out the code and use alternative bootstrap styles to create a cooler effect.
