          <H2>Brendan's Bio</H2>

          <img src="BC Headshot.jpg" width="200px">
          <p>Brendan Cusack is a former materials processing engineer at CoolCAD Electronics, where he led the team that
            implements the silicon carbide micro-fabrication processing in the cleanroom. During his time at CoolCAD,
            Cusack implemented the process engineering for silicon carbide MOSFETs, JFETs, photodiodes, avalanche
            photodiodes, and integrated circuitry. He has developed in-house techniques for activation, oxidation, wet/dry
            etching, and several other silicon carbide and germanium specific process techniques. For his work, Brendan has been named as a co-inventors on <b>3 US Patents.</b> Since leaving CoolCAD,
            Cusack has started a private SAT/ACT Prep company that also focuses on STEM education for undergraduates and high school students. He spends his days developing curriculum and his evenings/weekends elucidating core STEM and English
            principles to students. He has received <b>perfect SAT scores</b> and <b>3 perfect subject test scores</b> and has fantastic command of English language.</p>

            <p>For better or worse, it looks like colleges will be moving away from the SAT in the coming years.  As such, Brendan is working to reposition himself to be a leader in the educational technology space. Having self-taught programming through w3 schools, CodeCademy, and several resources, Brendan has enrolled in this MIT program to further refine his skillset and receive valuable credentials to facilitate his pivot. Brendan currently has an undergraduate degree in chemistry and a masters degree in electronic materials engineering</p>
